<h1 align="center"> Automated CCTV surveillance with Machine Learning </h1>


## 🤔 Problem
Cameras are everywhere but most of them are dumb devices that simply record the videos. But we can make them smart with computer vision. With CV, cameras can detect people based on their faces, recognize body posture to identify the activities and send alerts for malicious behaviours.

## ✨ Features
- Web/Mobile Dashboard to display all the collected data from different devices.
- Django application for data collection from public CCTV cameras
- Alerts when blacklisted/unknown people are detected
- Tech Stack : React, maybe Flutter/Kotlin, Django and lots of ML stuff
